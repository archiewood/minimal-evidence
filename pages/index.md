# Welcome to Minimal Evidence

This project shows how to use Evidence to create a minimal site from markdown files, with no data sources.

Edit the file in the `pages` directory to change the content of the page.

This project also includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy the site to GitHub Pages

<Alert status=warning>
    Note that links and non-index pages will not work unless you have a custom domain and deploy it to the root due to https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence/discussions/2329
